## Minutes from meeting 01 Oct 1630

Question - Recessions and the market indicators and responses pre recession and post recession seeking to understand what sectors are more resilient to recession and why.

ERD diagram and justification for the database model - DBeaver as an option for generating this diagram

Programming language will be Python

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplot
- package for time series packages

GIT usage - set of rules for GIT usage?
- Atlasian rules for GIT usage - determine if they have any and if they are suitable
- Github rules at this link https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/ to understand how we might develop some.

- Own work on their own branch then merge them onto a master branch is an option until a set of rules/ processes are put in place

Project outline in broad steps with a draft timeline
Step 1 - Gather the data and post into mysql (7 Days) 8 Oct
Step 2 - Build Database Structure and confirm update mechanism// clean data (5 Days) 13 Oct
Step 3 - Run EDA focussed on recessions and market sectors (3 Days) 16 Oct

** Review processes and tasks to date with a view to allocate and plan future tasking.
** Consider splitting into teams to finalise the paper
** Draft individual reports around here also to ensure they are underway with lessons and insights

Step 4 - Confirm the insight we are going to publish and the publishing mechanism to be used (Markdown etc) TBC
Step 5 - Draft report for review and compile GITHUB insights TBC
Step 6 - publish report for review 29 Nov
Ongoing - review GITHUB every 7 Days and publish insights for use in individual and group reports// determine the best way to evaluate these indights??


7 Day task - gather as much data as possible and get it into the database then we will determine the

Next meeting will be in 7 Days time 08 Oct @ 1630 - Yun to co-ord the zoom meeting

## Minutes from meeting  09 Oct 1600

Points from last meeting:
- RDS is coming along, there are several tables in the RDS and we are at the point that we can do some EDA on the data we have
- GIT rules still remain outstanding, more to follow on this for the next meeting - James
- RDS structure still needs attending to - James

The insight we were looking for was discussed at length with a vote conducted which narrows the focus down to the ASX and the factors that affect it.

The idea of the recession and looking into it in more detail was put to the side as it was considered to be too big of a task for this assignment.

The following tasks were allocated
- EDA on sectors and industries - Priya/ Yixia
- EDA on GDP and the ASX and US markets and the ASX - James/ Min
- EDA on House prices and the ASX and House Prices and GDP - Cynthia
- EDA on cash rate and exchange rate with lending and borrowing rates - Yun

Each team is to create a branch, labelling it the specific aspect for the project, from the Master.

Several group members have presentations and papers due over the coming week so the decision was made to delay the next meeting until 18th Oct 4pm

Admin - all coding is to be done in Jupyter notebooks and loaded into the repository in the relevant branch

Next meeting is for Sunday 18th Oct 4pm
