## GIT Policies Implemented for the group

Some rules for the following items:

### Master
  - the master branch is managed by one person.
  - Folders are created on the master and they are directly relatable to the project and an aspect of the complete pipeline - example folder are below:
    - Data collection and Database management
    - Data Analysis and insight gathering
    - Publication of the results to production

### Branch Policy
    - Branches are to be made close to the 'Trunk' where fixes and features are built then integrated quickly back to the master. Ideally
