Some rules for the following items:
Master
  - the master branch is managed by one person.
  - Three folders are created on the master:
    - Data collection and base management
    - Data Analysis and production
    - Publication of the results
  - Branches are created in one of these folders to with the ultimate goal to have a single file that forms the basis of the data pipeline across each of the elements required to enable the complete data-pipeline from collection through to publication of results.
