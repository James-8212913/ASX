### Why was this chosen

Amazon offered initial free tier to run a 'beta test' to run an executable example of what the final product would look like. Key aspects when considering the Amazon RDS framework and the MySQL language to support it are both the reliability and the ability to scale the initial product if required. This could easily be replicated in a secure manner across any number of company endorsed systems.

## Why Python was chosen

In order to better understand why Python was chosen as the language for the project the following criteria will be considered. These were drive by the nature of the project that was being considered - a general end to end project with limited if any detailed statistical analysis. With this in mind Python was chose over R principally for its utility from end to end - the single language can by used across the complete Data Pipeline.

### Speed and Performance

Both R and Python are Objective languages in the way they process Data, this means that they sacrifice speed relative to c and other more primal languages. Both R and Python will be slower than SQL but what they lose in speed they more than make up for deployability and consistency as a single language across the complete project. Critically, for this project the speed wasn't critical for the system as such the utility that Python offers tips the scales in favour of Python.

### Graphics and Visualisations

R has got is on Python in this instance. The visualisations possible with R are of a higher quality generally than those from Python for a similar amount of code. In saying this, Python still offers a significant number of options and the graphics produced are of production quality. If the product was to be progressed further the use of Plotly could be integrated to ensure the visualisations were interactive and more user friendly. 

### Deployability and Maintainability

Both codes are highly deployable but R takes more maintenance than Python does generally. R's principal use is for statistical analysis, not for general deployment of end to end products. Conversely, Python's statistical packages are not quite as strong but they are more than capable of dealing with the simple statistical nature of this project therefore Python is a better choice for Deployability and Maintainability in this instance. This is particularly evident with the deployment of relatively simply script to create a static website with Python and some basic HTML with an associated CSS style sheet to support deployment into production.

### Number of Packages

There are both a significant number of packages for both languages but Python's philosophy is that there should be one simple way to complete a task - a such the number of packages for Python may be slightly less than R. Conversely when using R in a collaborative environment there may be different choices for the packages used as such collaboration can be more challenging.
